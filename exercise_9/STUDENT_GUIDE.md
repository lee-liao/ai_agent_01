## Exploration Activities

### Activity 1: Understand the Agent Pipeline (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Trace a document through the entire multi-agent pipeline

1. Read `backend/app/agents/pipeline.py` - the orchestrator
2. Identify how agents are called in sequence
3. Find where HITL checks occur
4. Trace data flow from document to final output

**Questions to Answer**:
- What happens if an agent fails?
- How does the Classifier's output influence the Extractor?
- When exactly is HITL triggered?
- What data is passed between agents?

### Activity 2: Explore PII Detection (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand how PII is detected and redacted

1. Read `backend/app/agents/extractor.py`
2. Study the `PII_PATTERNS` dictionary
3. Examine the `_redact_value()` method
4. Test different PII patterns

**Experiments**:
- Add a new PII type (e.g., passport number)
- Try different redaction modes
- Test edge cases (malformed SSN, international phone numbers)
- See how context is extracted

**Challenge**: Create a PII pattern for driver's license numbers

### Activity 3: Test Red Team Scenarios (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand security testing and attack vectors

1. Read `backend/app/agents/redteam.py`
2. Run each predefined red team test
3. Analyze why some pass and some fail
4. Study the attack detection logic

**Tasks**:
- Run all 5 predefined tests via UI
- Examine results for each attack type
- Identify what makes an attack successful vs blocked
- Propose a new attack vector

**Challenge**: Design a new red team test for a bypass technique not covered

### Activity 4: Implement Custom Policy (60 minutes)

**Goal**: Add a new policy rule to the system

**Scenario**: Add a policy that flags documents containing crypto wallet addresses

1. **Add Pattern Detection** (`extractor.py`):
```python
# Add to PII_PATTERNS
"crypto_wallet": r"\b[13][a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{25,34}\b",  # Bitcoin address
```

2. **Add Policy Rule** (`main.py`):
```python
"crypto_policy": {
    "name": "Cryptocurrency Policy",
    "rules": {
        "detect_wallets": True,
        "require_hitl": True,
        "allowed_usage": "none"
    }
}
```

3. **Add Reviewer Check** (`reviewer.py`):
```python
# In _check_policy_violations()
if "crypto_wallet" in [p["type"] for p in pii_entities]:
    violations.append({
        "type": "cryptocurrency_detected",
        "severity": "high",
        "description": "Document contains cryptocurrency wallet address",
        "policy": "Cryptocurrency Policy"
    })
```

4. **Test**: Upload a document with a Bitcoin address and verify it's flagged

### Activity 5: Analyze KPI Calculations (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand how performance metrics are calculated

1. Read `backend/app/main.py` - the `/api/reports/kpis` endpoint
2. Identify how each KPI is computed
3. Find what data sources are used
4. Consider edge cases

**Questions**:
- How is PII F1 score calculated? (Currently simulated - what would real calculation need?)
- Why is "unauthorized disclosures" always zero? (Is this realistic?)
- What defines "completed within SLA"?
- How could you make KPIs more accurate?

**Challenge**: Implement real F1 score calculation for PII detection

### Activity 6: Improve HITL Workflow (60 minutes)

**Goal**: Enhance the human review process

**Current State**: HITL queue shows items, user approves/rejects

**Enhancement Ideas**:
1. Add priority levels (critical/high/medium/low)
2. Implement timeout warnings for pending approvals
3. Add bulk approval for low-risk items
4. Show statistical recommendations

**Implementation**:
- Choose one enhancement
- Modify backend logic
- Update frontend UI
- Test workflow

### Activity 7: Create Test Documents (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Build comprehensive test cases

Create 3 new test documents:

1. **High-Risk NDA**
   - Multiple PII types (SSN, credit card, bank account)
   - Financial terms exceeding threshold
   - Forbidden advice language
   - Missing required disclaimers

2. **Clean Service Agreement**
   - No PII
   - Standard clauses
   - All required disclaimers present
   - Within all policy limits

3. **Tricky Edge Cases**
   - Partial PII (incomplete SSN)
   - Lookalike characters (unicode)
   - Encoded content (base64)
   - False positives

**Process**:
1. Create markdown files in `data/sample_documents/`
2. Upload via UI
3. Run review process
4. Analyze agent results
5. Verify correct classification and flagging

### Activity 8: Red Team Your Own System (90 minutes)

**Goal**: Find vulnerabilities through adversarial testing

**Methodology**:
1. **Brainstorm attacks**: List 5 ways to bypass PII detection
2. **Implement tests**: Add to `redteam.py` or test via UI
3. **Document findings**: Which attacks succeed?
4. **Propose fixes**: How would you prevent each attack?
5. **Implement one fix**: Choose the highest priority

**Example Attack Vectors**:
- Leetspeak variations (e.g., `3m@il@ddr3ss.c0m`)
- Whitespace injection (`S SN: 1 2 3-4 5-6 7 8 9`)
- Concatenation across lines
- Homoglyph substitution (Cyrillic Ð° vs Latin a)
- JSON/XML encoding
- Comment hiding (`<!-- SSN: 123-45-6789 -->`)
