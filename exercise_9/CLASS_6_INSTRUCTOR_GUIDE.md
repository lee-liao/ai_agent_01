            max_amount = policy.get("rules", {}).get("max_amount", 50000)
            
            if amount > max_amount:
                violations.append({
                    "type": "payment_amount_exceeded",
                    "severity": "high",

            )
            
            # Merge base risk with context risk
            final_risk = self._merge_risks(match.risk, context_risk)
            
            # Filter out likely false positives
            if self._is_likely_real_pii(match, context_risk):

## 🔍 What to Look For in Code Reviews

### Good Code:
- ✅ Follows existing patterns
- ✅ Has comments explaining why
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Includes tests
- ✅ Is readable

### Red Flags:
- ❌ Copy-pasted without understanding
- ❌ No error handling
- ❌ Hardcoded values everywhere
- ❌ No tests or documentation
- ❌ Breaks existing functionality

### Feedback Examples:

**Good:**
> "Nice implementation! Consider adding error handling for when the regex doesn't match. Also, document why you chose this specific pattern."

**Needs Work:**
> "This works but could be improved. The regex is too broad and will match non-PII. Try adding word boundaries (\\b). Also add tests for edge cases."

**Needs Revision:**
> "This doesn't meet the requirements. The policy check isn't integrated with the reviewer agent. Please review the pipeline.py to see how agents are called."

## 🆘 Office Hours FAQ

### Q: My PII detection isn't working
**A:** Check:
1. Is the regex pattern correct? Test on regex101.com
2. Is the pattern added to PII_PATTERNS dict?
3. Is the redaction logic in _redact_value()?
4. Are you testing with the right format?

### Q: HITL isn't triggering
**A:** Check:
1. Is the condition met? (e.g., high risk detected)
2. Is _create_hitl_request() being called?
3. Is the HITL item in the queue? Check /api/hitl/queue
4. Check audit logs for clues

### Q: Chat security isn't blocking attacks
**A:** Check:
1. Is the pattern in PROMPT_INJECTION_PATTERNS?
2. Is the regex correct? (re.IGNORECASE flag)
3. Is the severity high enough?
4. Test the pattern in isolation first

### Q: My red team test always passes
**A:** Make sure you're returning:
- `"passed": False` when vulnerability found
- `"passed": True` when attack is blocked
(Counter-intuitive but correct!)
