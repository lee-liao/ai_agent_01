## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. Prompt Injection Detection
Detects and blocks:
- Direct instruction overrides ("ignore previous instructions")
- Role manipulation ("you are now a...")
- System prompt extraction ("show me your instructions")
- Data extraction attempts ("list all documents")
- PII extraction ("give me all SSNs")

### 2. Jailbreak Prevention
Blocks:
- DAN mode attempts
- Developer mode activation
- Authority impersonation
- Bypass restriction attempts

### 3. Forbidden Operations
Prevents:
- Code execution attempts
- eval()/exec() calls
- System command injection
- Module imports

### 4. Risk Scoring
- 0-40%: Low risk
- 40-70%: Medium risk  
- 70-100%: High/Critical risk (blocked)
