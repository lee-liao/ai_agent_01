## 🚀 How to Test

### **Prerequisites**
- **Backend**: Running on port 8000 ✅
- **Frontend**: Running on port 3080 ✅
- **Microphone**: Connected and accessible
- **Browser**: Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (supports WebRTC)

### **Step-by-Step Test**

#### **1. Open Two Browser Windows**

**Window 1 - Agent:**
```
URL: http://localhost:3080/auth/signin
Login: agent1 / agent123
```

**Window 2 - Customer:**
```
URL: http://localhost:3080/customer
Name: John Doe (or any name)
```

#### **2. Establish Connection**

**Agent (Window 1):**
1. Click **"Start Call"**
2. Wait for message: "Waiting for customer..."

**Customer (Window 2):**
1. Click **"Start Chat"**
2. Click **"Connect to Agent"**
3. See message: "Connected to agent1!"

**Agent sees:**
```
✅ "Connected to customer: John Doe"
```

#### **3. Test Text Chat First**

Before testing audio, verify text messaging works:

**Customer types:** "Hello, I need help"
→ **Agent sees it immediately**

**Agent types:** "Hello! I'm here to help"
→ **Customer sees it immediately**

✅ If text chat works, connection is solid!

#### **4. Enable Audio on Customer Side**

**Customer (Window 2):**
1. Click **"Start Voice Call"** button (purple)
2. Browser prompts: "Allow microphone access" → Click **"Allow"**
3. See audio controls appear:
   - 🔴 Audio level meter (shows green bar when speaking)
   - 🎤 Mute button
   - 📢 Status: "Voice call active - speak naturally"

**Speak into microphone:**
- Watch the **audio level meter** move
- Every 1 second, audio chunks are sent to backend
- Console shows: `📤 Sent audio chunk: XXXX bytes`

#### **5. Enable Audio on Agent Side**

**Agent (Window 1):**
1. Click **"Enable Voice"** button (blue)
2. Browser prompts: "Allow microphone access" → Click **"Allow"**
3. See audio controls appear:
   - 🔴 Audio level meter
   - 🎤 Mute button
   - 📢 Status: "Listening... Speak to the customer"

**Speak into microphone:**
- Watch the **audio level meter** respond
- Audio chunks are sent and routed to customer

#### **6. Test Mute/Unmute**

**Customer:**
- Click mute button (microphone icon turns red)
- Speak → No audio sent (meter still moves, but data not transmitted)
- Click unmute → Audio sending resumes

**Agent:**
- Same behavior as customer

#### **7. Test Device Switching** (If Multiple Mics)

**If you have multiple microphones:**
1. Look for device selector dropdown (appears when audio enabled)
2. Select different microphone
3. Audio automatically switches to new device

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### **Audio Level Meter**
```
🔊 [████████--------] 
   0% ←--------→ 100%
```
- **Gray bar**: No audio/silence
- **Purple bar (Customer)**: Speaking detected
- **Blue bar (Agent)**: Speaking detected

### **Status Messages**

**Customer:**
- 🟢 "Voice call active - speak naturally"
- 🔴 "Microphone muted"

**Agent:**
- 🟢 "Listening... Speak to the customer"
- 🔴 "Microphone muted"

---

## 🔍 Backend Logs

When audio is working, you'll see in backend logs (`/tmp/backend.log`):

```bash
📊 Received audio chunk: 4096 bytes from call_abc123
📤 Forwarded audio from call_abc123 to call_def456
📊 Received audio chunk: 3840 bytes from call_def456
📤 Forwarded audio from call_def456 to call_abc123
```

This shows **bidirectional audio streaming**!

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### **What Works Now:**

1. **Microphone Access** ✅
   - Browser requests permission
   - Audio is captured from selected device
   - Visual feedback via level meter

2. **Audio Transmission** ✅
   - Audio chunks sent every 1 second
   - Backend receives and logs chunks
   - Audio forwarded to partner in call

3. **Audio Controls** ✅
   - Start/Stop audio call
   - Mute/unmute microphone
   - Select audio device
   - Visual level indicators

4. **Simulated Transcription** ✅
   - Occasional transcription messages appear
   - Format: `[Voice] "sample phrase"`
   - Helps visualize voice activity

### **What's Simulated (For Students to Implement):**

1. **Real Transcription** 🚧
   - Currently: Random phrases displayed
   - Production: Connect to OpenAI Whisper API
   - Send audio chunks → Get real-time text

2. **AI Suggestions** 🚧
   - Currently: Mock suggestions in UI
   - Production: Send transcript → LLM → Get agent suggestions
   - Display: "Suggest offering discount" etc.

3. **Customer Database Lookup** 🚧
   - Currently: Mock customer data
   - Production: Query database based on phone/account
   - Display: Order history, tickets, etc.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Microphone Not Working?**

1. **Check Browser Permissions:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Site Settings → Microphone
   - Make sure `localhost:3080` is allowed

2. **Check Device:**
   - System Settings → Sound → Input
   - Ensure microphone is connected and not muted

3. **Check Console:**
   - Open Browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for microphone errors
   - Should see: `🎤 Microphone access granted`

### **Audio Level Meter Not Moving?**

- Speak louder or closer to microphone
- Check system audio input level
- Try selecting different microphone device
- Refresh page and try again

### **Backend Not Receiving Audio?**

```bash
# Check backend logs:
tail -f /tmp/backend.log

# Should see:
📊 Received audio chunk: XXXX bytes from call_XXXXX
```

If not appearing:
- Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Restart backend: See commands below

### **Connection Issues?**

```bash
# Check backend:
curl http://localhost:8000/api/calls/stats

# Expected output:
{"active_calls":1,"waiting_customers":0,"available_agents":0,...}
```
