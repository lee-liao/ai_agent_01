## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Customer Context Integration
The system SHALL fetch and display comprehensive customer context (profile, orders, tickets) at call start with precise timing for agent preparation.

#### Scenario: Customer Context Fetch on Call Start
- **WHEN** a call starts and a customer identifier is available
- **THEN** the backend immediately fetches comprehensive customer details
- **AND** sends a `customer_context` message with profile, recent orders, and tickets to the agent
- **AND** the frontend displays this information in the customer info panel

#### Scenario: Context Timing for Agent Preparation
- **WHEN** customer context is being fetched during call initialization
- **THEN** the system does not block the voice/audio connection process
- **AND** context data is delivered asynchronously for immediate agent access
- **AND** the agent can begin conversation while context loads in background

#### Scenario: Context Display with Audit Trail Integration
- **WHEN** customer context is displayed in the agent interface
- **THEN** the system integrates this information with the unified conversation timeline
- **AND** maintains precise timestamps for audit trail purposes
- **AND** provides clear visual indication of context source and freshness

### Requirement: Unified Timeline with Precise Timestamps
The system SHALL maintain millisecond-precision timestamps for all conversation elements (chat messages, voice transcriptions, AI suggestions, customer context) to ensure comprehensive audit trail capability.

#### Scenario: Timeline Integration for All Elements
- **WHEN** any conversation element is added (message, transcription, suggestion, context)
- **THEN** the system stores it with millisecond-precision timestamp
- **AND** maintains chronological order across all element types
- **AND** provides this unified timeline for audit and analysis purposes

#### Scenario: Audit Trail Preservation
- **WHEN** conversation elements are stored for audit trail purposes
- **THEN** the system preserves all timestamp information with full precision
- **AND** maintains correlation between related elements (e.g., chat message and its AI suggestion)
- **AND** ensures temporal sequence integrity for compliance reporting
