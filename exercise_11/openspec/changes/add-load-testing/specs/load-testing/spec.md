# Load Testing Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Load Test Scenarios
The system SHALL provide load testing scenarios covering typical and peak usage.

#### Scenario: Baseline load (10 VUs)
- **WHEN** K6 runs with 10 virtual users for 5 minutes
- **THEN** all metrics are collected
- **AND** baseline performance is established

#### Scenario: Normal load (50 VUs)
- **WHEN** K6 runs with 50 virtual users for 10 minutes
- **THEN** system maintains SLOs
- **AND** p95 latency ≤ 2.5s

#### Scenario: Peak load (100 VUs)
- **WHEN** K6 runs with 100 virtual users for 15 minutes
- **THEN** system maintains SLOs
- **AND** error rate ≤ 1%

### Requirement: Concurrent WebSocket Testing
Load tests SHALL include concurrent WebSocket connections.

#### Scenario: Simultaneous sessions
- **WHEN** 50 concurrent WebSocket connections are established
- **THEN** all connections receive responses
- **AND** no connections time out

### Requirement: Metrics Collection
Load tests SHALL collect comprehensive performance metrics.

#### Scenario: Metrics captured
- **WHEN** a load test completes
- **THEN** the following metrics are recorded: requests/second, p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, connection count
- **AND** saved to `load/reports/`

### Requirement: SLO Verification
Load test reports SHALL verify SLO compliance.

#### Scenario: SLO pass
- **WHEN** p95 latency ≤ 2.5s AND error rate ≤ 1%
- **THEN** the report shows "PASS"

#### Scenario: SLO fail
- **WHEN** p95 latency > 2.5s OR error rate > 1%
- **THEN** the report shows "FAIL" with details

### Requirement: Automated Test Runner
The system SHALL provide a script to run all load tests.

#### Scenario: Run all tests
- **WHEN** `./load/run_tests.sh` is executed
- **THEN** both K6 and Locust tests run sequentially
- **AND** results are saved to `load/reports/`
- **AND** a summary report is generated

### Requirement: Load Testing Documentation
The `load/README.md` SHALL provide clear instructions.

#### Scenario: Documentation completeness
- **WHEN** a developer reads `load/README.md`
- **THEN** they can: install tools, run tests, interpret results, troubleshoot issues
