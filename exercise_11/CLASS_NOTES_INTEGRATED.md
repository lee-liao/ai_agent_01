## New Proposals Added

### 1. Refusal Templates UI (`add-refusal-templates-ui`)
**From Class Notes #2**: Supportive copy + links; render in UI

**Why Added**: The original safety proposal covered classification and basic refusals, but the class notes emphasize the importance of empathetic, supportive refusal UI with resource links.

**Key Additions**:
- ✅ Empathetic refusal copy for all categories
- ✅ Resource links (hotlines, referrals)
- ✅ Dedicated `RefusalMessage.tsx` UI component
- ✅ Supportive styling (warm colors, not harsh)
- ✅ Pass criteria: ALL refusals have empathy + resource link

**Tasks**: 28 implementation tasks

**Files Created**:
- `openspec/changes/add-refusal-templates-ui/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/add-refusal-templates-ui/tasks.md`
- `openspec/changes/add-refusal-templates-ui/specs/safety-guardrails/spec.md`

---

### 2. Alpha Test Protocol (`add-alpha-test-protocol`)
**From Class Notes #14**: Alpha test protocol with consent, feedback, and issue tracking

**Why Added**: Critical for validating the system with real users before broader launch. Not covered in original 12 proposals.

**Key Additions**:
- ✅ Alpha test plan for 10-20 parent testers
- ✅ Informed consent process
- ✅ Feedback form (helpfulness rating, concerns)
- ✅ Issue logging system (P0/P1/P2 severity)
- ✅ Pass criteria: ≥80% "felt helpful", 0 P0 safety bugs

**Tasks**: 46 implementation tasks

**Files Created**:
- `openspec/changes/add-alpha-test-protocol/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/add-alpha-test-protocol/tasks.md`
- `openspec/changes/add-alpha-test-protocol/specs/alpha-testing/spec.md`

---

### 3. Demo & One-Pager (`add-demo-and-onepager`)
**From Class Notes #15**: 2-minute demo + one-pager with metrics

**Why Added**: Essential stakeholder deliverable for demonstrating capabilities and showing metrics alignment with SLOs. Not covered in original 12 proposals.

**Key Additions**:
- ✅ 2-minute demo video (3 flows: refusal, normal advice, HITL)
- ✅ One-pager report (metrics, risks, next steps)
- ✅ Reproducible demo via `docker compose up`
- ✅ Pass criteria: Demo reproducible, metrics align with SLOs

**Tasks**: 44 implementation tasks

**Files Created**:
- `openspec/changes/add-demo-and-onepager/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/add-demo-and-onepager/tasks.md`
- `openspec/changes/add-demo-and-onepager/specs/demo-deliverables/spec.md`

## Implementation Priority

The 3 new proposals fit into the implementation timeline:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Safety (Weeks 1-2)
1. Safety & Scope Policy
2. **Refusal Templates UI** ⭐ NEW (immediate follow-up to #1)
3. Curated RAG Pack
4. Docker & Health Checks

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch (Weeks 7-8)
- ...
- Accessibility & UX Polish
- **Alpha Test Protocol** ⭐ NEW (runs 2 weeks)
- **Demo & One-Pager** ⭐ NEW (final deliverable)

---

## Key Insights from Class Notes

### 1. Refusal Quality Matters
The class notes emphasized that refusals shouldn't just block requests—they should:
- Show empathy and understanding
- Provide actionable resources
- Maintain user trust
- Look supportive, not harsh

This led to a dedicated proposal for refusal UI/UX.

### 2. User Validation is Critical
Alpha testing wasn't in the original README but is essential:
- Real parent feedback before launch
- Structured issue tracking
- Safety bug identification
- Helpfulness validation

### 3. Stakeholder Communication
Demo and one-pager are crucial for:
- Executive decision-making
- Showing metrics alignment
- Risk transparency
- Next steps planning

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review the 3 new proposals**:
   ```bash
   openspec show add-refusal-templates-ui
   openspec show add-alpha-test-protocol
   openspec show add-demo-and-onepager
   ```

2. **Prioritize in implementation plan**:
   - Refusal Templates UI → Implement right after Safety Policy
   - Alpha Test Protocol → Schedule for weeks 7-8 (2-week duration)
   - Demo & One-Pager → Final deliverable after all features complete

3. **Adjust timeline** if needed to accommodate 118 additional tasks
